            <h2>Responsive Web design.</h2>
              <p>If you intend to create an online prescence, make no mistake it must be responsive. We now design a website as a set of modules that can come together and respond to 
              whatever viewing medium it is being called upon. Let's say for arguments sake, there are a range of ten variations of screen size for each mobile phone, tablet, and desktop computer.</p> <img src="images/misc/digital_responsive.jpeg" class="img-thumbnail img-responsive"><span>
              
              <p>A quick calculation tells you thats just forty different devices to test and make sure that your message presents and functions well. That is no where near what is required now (many more). We now build from a mobile first perspective and focus on what is core to the user. For example the carousel on this website will not be visible when the viewport is detected as being a mobile phone, its more important that the copy be read than the images.</p>
